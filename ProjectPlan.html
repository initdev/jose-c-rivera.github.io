	<h1>Project Plan.</h1>
	<h2>-Completed Features-</h2>
	  <p><b>Feature:</b> Map Zoom Function</p>
	  <p><b>Description:</b> The map zoom function will aid in navigation when attempting to click on smaller countries.</p>
	  <p><b>Feasibility:</b> This feature is quite feasible by utilizing an open-source package such as <a href ="http://jvectormap.com/">jVectorMap</a>.</p>
	  <p><b>Dependency:</b> The rest of the project is not dependent on this, although from a UX standpoint, it is important.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h2>-Potential Features-</h2>
	  <p><b>Feature:</b> Online Ordering</p>
	  <p><b>Description:</b> The online ordering feature would allow a user to order directly from our app once a restaurant is discovered.</p>
	  <p><b>Feasibility:</b> This feature is feasible through: (1) The Just Eat API; (2) Embedding the Just Eat website; or (3) Providing the user a link to the proper Just Eat menu.</p>
	  <p><b>Dependency:</b> This is not a vital feature to our project, just an interesting add-on that would provide an additional use for the user.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p><b>Feature:</b> Randomize Restaurant</p>
	  <p><b>Description:</b> For those wishing to get real wild, the randomize restaurant feature would provide the user with a random restaurant to try.</p>
	  <p><b>Feasibility:</b> This would be a simple feature to implement by providing a completely random restaurant from either the Google Places or Yelp! APIs, or from the top trending restaurants list.</p>
	  <p><b>Dependency:</b> The rest of the project is not dependent on this feature, although it would be pretty nifty to include for those who lack decisiveness or simply want to experience something completely new.</p>
